    <hasBiography>   Chance played football for Ithaca College before earning degrees from New York University and Columbia University in English and Writing. But, after losing a bet and in spite of a profound fear of public speaking, he entered an acting class. He was so terrified that he gave his first monologue (Brick from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to a brick wall. While pursuing his acting career, he also entered the amateur boxing circuit in NYC, winning the Superheavyweight division of the NYC Metros tournament. The following year, he entered the NYC Golden Gloves, winning his first fight by knockout, only to have to subsequently drop out of the competition for work on a film. He played the role of Lt. Col. Stephen "Godfather" Ferrando in HBO's Generation Kill. On Memorial Day 2009, he was appointed Honorary Marine by the Marine Corps League (Cpl. Philip A. Reynolds Detachment - 203, Freehold, New Jersey) for his work in Generation Kill. Chance remains forever indebted to the Marines for this honor, and regards them as the backbone of this country. He continues his writing pursuits and has three scripts in development now.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Raymond J. Vandermast   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Mark Ivanir has been working as a professional film and television actor in Los Angeles since 2001. His first major film role was in Steven Spielberg's 1993 Oscar winning epic Schindler's List. He rejoined with Spielberg twice, first for a cameo appearance in Terminal, then again for Tintin. A pivotal role in Robert De Niro's 2006 film, The Good Shepherd, landed Mark a role in Barry Levinson's What Just Happened, this time acting alongside De Niro. He has booked over 35 Guest Star and Guest Lead roles on television shows such as: 24, Monk, CSI NY, Law and Order, Fringe, CSI Miami, Nikita and many others.Ivanir's road to Hollywood was circuitous at best. Born in the communist Ukraine (former USSR), he immigrated to Israel with his family in 1972. While serving in the Israeli Army he participated in the then clandestine mission to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel. His military experience and expertise has been tapped for various TV and Film roles.After completing his stint in the Military, Ivanir turned down several job offers from Israel's Secret Service, and gave up studying medicine to pursue a higher vocation-clowning. He completed two years in a Circus school, traveled throughout Europe performing on the streets, and ended up working in a Parisian Circus - Cirque Pawelles.

    <hasBiography>   Terry Dale Parks is a film and television actor originally from Southern Oklahoma where now owns the family ranch he grew up on which is dear to his heart since his family settled on the land in the early 1930s. His son, Coy, is named after his Grandfather who originally purchased the property where the family has farmed and raised cattle and horses for the past 80 years.His past film and television include, Thor, Olympus Has Fallen, When The Game Stands Tall, GiJoe2, Man of the House, Friday Night Lights, Homeland, Nashville, Justified, Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde, Revolution and many moreSince Terry grew up on a horse and cattle ranch, he learned to love animals and care for them so naturally nature and conservation are extremely important for him and his family. For several years he trained horses on the ranch.His love for acting extends back to his childhood. , with few resources that were artistic in nature in his rural area, Terry relied on his imagination and love of the Carol Burnett Show and Andy Griffith for entertainment. During his 6th grade year at Pernell, the new English teacher started the Pernell Speech and Oral Interpretation Team. While most kids thought the new teacher and his team were strange, Terry was fascinated. When his older brother joined, even though he was too young to compete, Terry traveled to watch the team in action and imagined himself competing as an actor. As soon as he was eligible to join the team as a freshman, he did. By his junior year of high school, he was competing on the national level. In 1989, he placed 3rd in Humorous Interpretation at the National Forensic League's National Tournament. His love of speech continued into college at the University of Oklahoma, where he and his brother started OU's speech and debate team. Within two years, the team was ranked as one of the top five teams in the nation, with Terry winning numerous national championships in several interpretation events. Terry even taught competitive drama for a few years in Texas and several of the kids he mentored went on to become national finalists and even national champions.After college, Terry continued to chase what fascinated him. He set his sights on film and tv work, moving all he owned out to Los Angeles in his '83 Chevy pickup. As he pursued a career in film work, he inherited the ranch where he grew up. The years in LA pursuing acting had left him a bit weary and homesick for the lifestyle on the ranch he loved so much, so he moved back to the ranch in Oklahoma started working with animals again and started an oil and gas business.Within a few months he met a casting director while tagging along to a workshop. A few weeks later she cast him in his first feature film. He continued to build a film and television resume as well as his oil and gas business in Oklahoma for many years until the entertainment business pulled him back to the Los Angeles area.Nowadays, Terry splits his time between the film business in LA and New Orleans, and the ranch in Oklahoma where he lives with his beloved wife, Amber, 16 month old son, Coy, two dogs, Leo and Lilly, and cat, Pearl.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Terry Parks   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Erol was born and raised in Adana, Turkey from where he received a full scholarship to attend the University of Okan in Istanbul, studying hotel management. But Erol's time at university found him more attracted to performance and theatre, and he turned his back on his formal studies to audition in drama schools. With his parents dead-against his new career choice, Erol packed up and headed for Germany, without a plan or much knowledge of German. Within a short time he got a grip on the language, and impressed the Head of Drama at the prestigious Folkwang University of Arts to allow Erol to participate as an actor and assistant in various productions. He since landed theatre rolls with the Ballhaus Theatre, MAxim Gorki Theatre and makes his film debut in Anthony Maras' "The Palace".   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Hakan Dilaver   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Jeff Albertson was born in Bloomington, IN, in 1963. After serving 8 years in the Navy as a pilot rescue swimmer, deep-sea diver, and survival Instructor, he attended Indiana University. At college he majored in Physical education, as well as working for the University Police Dept. Jeff became interested in acting after doing a community theatre production of "Rumors" by Neal Simon. Originally doing the play as a lark with his oldest daughter, Jeff was soon bitten by the acting bug. 14 plays later he had the opportunity to do some featured extra work for the film "The Dark Knight". A natural and very physical actor, Jeffs military experience, athletic background (he played semi-pro football, went to a world championships in power lifting, competed in strongman, highland games, as well as sprint-ironman distance triathlon) helped give him a leg up for parts in various professional productions. Acting and stunts have now been a passion of his, culminating in working 26 episodes of the Emmy award winning Showtime original series "Homeland", as actor, stuntman and stand-in for Damian Lewis. The 2014 film America employed Jeff to serve as stunt double for George Washington ( John Coopman). Jeff lives in Charleston, SC, with his Wife and two daughters.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Jeannette   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Gabriella Mary Hoffmann was born in New York City, New York, to actors Anthony Herrera and Viva (née Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann), who was a Warhol superstar. Her ancestry includes German, Irish, English, Puerto Rican, Spanish, and 1/16th Italian (Sicilian). She began acting in commercials at 4 to help pay the family bills but got tired of the work and quit. Gaby's first film role was as young "Maisy Russell" in 1988's O Meu Tio Solteiro (1989). Until the summer of 1993, Gaby had lived her entire life with her mother Viva and older sister, Alexandra Auder, at New York's notorious Chelsea Hotel. Viva and Gaby left in July after a longtime dispute with the management, but the hotel ended up featuring prominently in Gaby's future. Someone Like Me (1994) was hatched after one of the show's producers, Gail Berman, read a New York Times article about the Chelsea Hotel that mentioned a children's book that Viva and friend Jane Lancellotti wrote titled "Gaby at the Chelsea" (a takeoff on the classic "Eloise").Now that she and her mother are ensconced with their two Eskimo dogs in a two-bedroom rental house in Woodland Hills (it was badly damaged in the January 1994 earthquake), Gaby says she misses her former home (the Chelsea Hotel), where she and her best friend, Talya Shomron, would roller-skate in the hallways, spy on the drug dealer across the hall and dispatch the bellman to fetch ice cream at night from the neighborhood deli. Gaby has had well-received supporting roles in Um Homem Sem Rosto (1993), Minha Mãe É Um Problema!... (1992), Campo de Sonhos (1989) and Sintonia de Amor (1993). Gaby loved working with Nora Ephron, who directed Minha Mãe É Um Problema!... (1992) and Sintonia de Amor (1993), as well as with co-stars Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, and the late John Candy, but she found Kevin Costner "bossy".   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Tim Propert &amp;lt;tpropert@iprimus.com.au&amp;gt;   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Garrett Hines was born in New Orleans, Louisiana but grew up north of the city in the small town of Mandeville. Always interested in acting since a young age but never able to pursue it due to family tragedy, he graduated high school and attended college at Southeastern Louisiana University, where he would receive a Bachelor's Degree in English. While taking English 101, he wrote a narrative essay for class which his professor encouraged him to adapt and perform as a one-man show entitled "Ghost". It was the first time he performed. Six months later, he was cast in his first speaking role on the television show "K-Ville" for FOX. After receiving his degree, he returned for a Master's Degree Program and worked as a tutor in Southeastern Louisiana University's Writing Center. His professors would allow him time off for auditions and film/TV shoots under the agreement that all missed assignments would be made-up (he shot numerous commercials and films while still in graduate school, such as the SyFy Channel original movie "Scream of the Banshee"). After earning a Master's Degree in Creative Writing, Garrett has now fully dedicated his time to a career in acting. He has gone on to appear in such films as "Last Vegas" and "Stolen", as well as the TV series "Common Law" for USA Networks and the highly acclaimed Showtime series "Homeland". He can also be seen as Dean Parsing in WEtv's upcoming scripted series "South of Hell" and opposite Bryan Cranston in Jay Roach's upcoming film "Trumbo", where Garrett plays Andrew Hird.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Anonymous   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Aidan has a stammer. Being understood and heard didn't feature regularly as a kid. So when he found himself performing a one-liner role in a school play and the audience laughed with him, not at him, something clicked.After winning South Africa's Fleur Du Cap People's Choice Award for his performance in the comedy thriller stage production 'I Am Hamlet' Aidan turned to a need to tell a darker story of being an actor.'The Actor' is his debut feature as a director, producer, co-writer and lead actor. Filmed on a micro-budget of just under R50,000 in 2014 Aidan has learned many a hard lesson about feature filmmaking. However those lessons have proved valuable as he has gone onto multiple awards at the 48 Hour Film Project with his short film 'Weapon Of Choice', and to win the Mercedes Benz Bokeh International Fashion Film Festival with his short film 'The Choice' (he likes choice it seems). Most recently he has performed opposite Claire Danes in 'Homeland' and as the season regular Captain Jacob Garrett in Michael Bay's 'Black Sails'.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Whytewood Creative   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Palestinian-Israeli actor Makram Khoury was the youngest artist and the first Arab to win the Israel Prize, the highest artistic honor in the country.He is one of Israel's most respected actors, playing leads in all the major theatres as well as acting in films and on television.Khoury is an actor's actor: subtle, powerful and protean. He embodies many of the paradoxes of Israeli society. He was born to a Christian-Arab family who belonged to the Greek Orthodox church: Greek Orthodox, Christian, Arab, Palestinian. He and his family fled to Lebanon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. After five months of unemployment, Makram's lawyer father decided to risk returning rather than live in a refugee camp.Makram's family found housing in the Northern Israeli city of Acco. When he graduated high school in 1963, he went to study at The Hebrew University but soon dropped out to act. He trained with Jacqueline Kronberg-an American teacher who had worked with Second City-and also got involved with an Arab Theatre in Haifa. Eventually he went to Drama School in England.When he returned, even though he soon began getting work at The Cameri Theatre and the Haifa Municipal Theatre, he experienced an identity crisis. The Cameri arranged coaching for him in voice, diction and Hebrew. No professional Arabic theatre existed in Israel, only amateur companies. To fulfill himself as an actor, he had to work in Hebrew.Khoury came to a compromise with this situation through dreams." With help from his friend Anton Shamas, a distinguished Palestinian-Israeli writer, he decoded a message from his own unconscious. He saw himself as a clown in a circus sitting on a unicycle going around a circle, balancing with arms spread out, saying, 'I'm breathing, I'm alive! &amp;amp; saw a coin with two heads on the handlebars. On one side it said 'Israeli-Arab,' on the other, 'Israeli.' Acting managed to cure his wounds.Maintaining this balance is particularly challenging for Makram since the 2nd Intifada began. "I started to blame and hate my colleagues. I said: How will I go up on the Israeli stage and act in Hebrew? I can't, I can't. Then I see all these bombs, these terrorist acts that I disagree with, like many other Palestinians, and that brings me back to the balancing."Makram's wife Wadia is an Art Teacher. Two of his children - Clara &amp;amp; Jamil- are also actors. His daughter Rula is a Project Manager at The Science Museum in Jerusalem.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Paul Becker   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   The youngest of three brothers, Waleed was born in Sacramento, California, but grew up in Kuwait from the age of 5 until 19. He made frequent visits to his mother's family in San Francisco during the summer holidays and he was very fortunate that during his upbringing his family traveled extensively within the Middle East, Europe and the United States.He moved to the US to attend The George Washington University where he received a degree in Philosophy and Theatre. Waleed performed at various theaters in the Washington DC area after college including, The Folger Shakespeare Library, The Washington Shakespeare Company, The Studio Theatre, The Source Theatre, and the Keegan Theatre Company.In December of 2001, while still living in the DC area, Waleed made a trip to New York to audition for the West Coast Premiere of Tony Kushner's new play, Homebody/Kabul. He booked his first audition in New York sending him out to Berkeley, California for a successful run of the show and the start of what soon proved to be a promising theatre career in New York.Waleed then moved to New York and in less than 6 months landed his first job there in the Broadway production of Sixteen Wounded, by Eliam Kraiem (with Judd Hirsch and Martha Plimpton). He followed this up with a role in the hit off-Broadway play, Guantanamo: Honor Bound To Defend Freedom, ranked as "one of the best ten plays of 2004" by the Wall Street Journal and Entertainment Weekly. In his upcoming theatre credits Waleed attained further recognition as he was awarded a Drama Desk Award along with the rest of the cast for "2006 Outstanding Ensemble Performance" for David Hare's play at the Public Theatre, Stuff Happens directed by Tony Award-Winner Daniel Sullivan. He received extensive critical praise for his performance in this landmark production. He followed that up performing opposite Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in the Public Theatre's production of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage adapted by Tony Kushner and directed by Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe.Waleed's performances in supporting roles began to attract the attention of productions that were now looking at him for leading roles. He next starred in the US premiere production of David Greig's The American Pilot at the Manhattan Theatre Club, under the direction of Artistic Director Lynne Meadow. Shortly thereafter, Waleed found himself being whisked away to Tunisia to co-star in the Emmy-Award winning mini-series from HBO and the BBC, "House of Saddam" playing Saddam Hussein's best friend. The series received tremendous critical acclaim from around the globe, and Waleed's performance was hi-lighted in many international reviews. Having finished his work in Tunisia, Zuaiter headed the cast of Masked, an explosive play by Ilan Hatsor, starring as the eldest of three Palestinian brothers, set during the 1st Intifada and performed at the Daryl Roth 2 theater, Off-Broadway.On stage most recently Zuaiter enjoyed rave reviews for his heart-rending, and elegant portrayal of an Iraqi translator in the critically acclaimed, award-winning new play Betrayed, based upon (and scripted by) George Packer's widely lauded reporting of the Iraq war for The New Yorker. The play went on to receive a special one-night production at The Kennedy Center in the nation's capital, was filmed for PBS TV and was performed and taped at L.A. Theatreworks for national radio broadcast. All productions were directed by Naked Angels co-founding member and Artistic Director Pippin Parker. The Kennedy Center production received further attention because it was hosted by Refugees International as a special initiative for Iraqi refugees, and it was presented by Matt Dillon and Sarah Jessica Parker. Waleed takes special pride and has a deep affection for this milestone production in his career. The play prospered from a six-month run, Off-Broadway at the Culture Project.In the midst of the run of Betrayed, Zuaiter managed to finesse his performance schedule to allow him to work with the talented playwright Naomi Wallace in the Public Theatre Lab production of her three one-act plays Fever Chart, under the direction of Jo Bonney. His performance was hailed by the critics.Waleed's other notable credits from Film and TV are, most recently (2009), co-starring in the all-star cast of The Men Who Stare At Goats, performing along-side George Clooney and Ewan McGregor, and directed by Grant Heslov. The film also stars Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. Waleed attributes this to be "his break" into mainstream Hollywood films. He received notable mentions in select reviews that his performance and character depiction made a significant impact within the story.Waleed was featured in the DVD release of Tom McCarthy's The Visitor and was honored by McCarthy's commentary in the special features that he wanted to work with Waleed, a respected New York theatre actor. In a soon to be released film, Zuaiter makes an inspiring appearance as "the Lecturer" in the adaptation of Paulo Coelho's (The Alchemist) Veronika Decides To Die, directed by BAFTA Award-winner Emily Young. Zuaiter has guest starred on numerous TV shows, most recently in an episode of Lie To Me, and was directed by Spike Lee in a recurring role for an NBC pilot, M-O-N-Y. He is currently working on Sex And The City 2 in New York and Morocco (November, 2009).Zuaiter serves as Co-Executive Producer on the critically acclaimed annual New York Arab-American Comedy Festival (NYAACF) founded in 2003, which had its Los Angeles premiere in January of 2006. The NYAACF is the largest comedy festival in the US that brings together Arab-Americans to showcase a unique and edgy brand of humor. As Producer, Zuaiter has also optioned the screen rights for the PEN-Oakland Award-winner and celebrated novel, "On The Hills Of God," by Ibrahim Fawal. He owns options on other feature film properties that are in varying stages of development.Waleed is a graduate of The George Washington University, and the acclaimed Studio Theatre Acting Conservatory in Washington DC.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Sandy Erickson   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Lisa was born in New York City.After graduating from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts she started working immediately, her first role was as Viola in Twelfth Night (Shakespeare on the Sound Company) cast by Judy Henderson, through her college professor's, Marty Rader's referral. She then continued her work on Television as a Prosecuting Attorney on Law and Order: SVU, and other shows.Lisa's passion for the stage led to many theatrical productions. She acted in Wit in New York, working with Kathleen Chalfant. When Wit went on tour with Judith Light, Lisa played opposite her. Lisa performed all over the US and at the Barbican Center in London with the play "Love's Fire: Seven New Plays Inspired by Seven Shakespearean Sonnets." She was beyond thankful for the opportunity to work with amazing writers: Tony Kushner, John Guare, Marsha Norman, Bill Finn, N'Tozake Shange, the late Wendy Wasserstein, and Eric Bogosian. To this day, the first day of rehearsal for that production, as each playwright 'popped-in' to hear their play be read, was the pivotal point in her life which reinforced her career decision to be an actor. To observe and listen to each writer, one by one, discussing his/her work was one of the most riveting experiences of her stage career. Working on Love's Fire also earned her a play credit in its book publication, bringing the cast back to NYC to perform at the Public Theater.Lisa continued her growing success in television, working on Sex and the City, Third Watch and other TV shows. The following year, she received a call from a friend who was part of the NY production of King Hedley II. They needed an understudy, and a friend referred her to their production. This led to Lisa's second Broadway opportunity, as she performed with Brian Stokes Mitchell and Leslie Uggams numerous times. Lisa was thankful for the opportunity to work so closely with August Wilson, fellow actors and the production crew.During her final 8 month tour experience, Lisa was one of three actresses performing in the Vagina Monologues - directed by Joe Mantello. During her free time on tour, she helped raise awareness in ending violence against women, teaching movement/body-awareness' classes to various children/women shelters, survivors of domestic violence. This tour was to be her last before her move to Los Angeles.Lisa still holds a strong interest in the rights of children and survivors of domestic violence.In 2005, Lisa received several nominations -LA Drama Critics Circle, NAACP, LA Weekly, NAACP, Garland Honoree included - for Best Actress in a leading role for her portrayal of Medea in Euripides, Medea.Lisa is wide open for all theatrical opportunities (on stage and on camera) wherever they are. She ventured east to play the 12 foot tall Titania in Mark Lamo's elaborate and fantastic production of Midsummer Night's Dream at the Shakespeare Theater of Washington DC.Heading back east she performed at various venues, one being at the Celebration Theater in the musical, "The Women of Brewster Place" performing various roles for which the ensemble cast was nominated for an Ovation Award. Happily she joined the Circle X theater performing in "Chinese Massacre: Annotated", written by Tom Jacobsen. She was last seen performing in her hometown in New York City, where she now resides.Happy for all her accomplishments and the incredible artists she has met so far, Lisa continues her strong working actor path in stage, film, and television, and is open to all projects.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  -MB   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   TJ Hassan spent most of his younger years moving from city to city overseas, until finally settling in the US in 1993. He is the middle child of 7 children of a Microbiologist father and a stay at home mother. TJ worked in corporate management and played music locally with several bands, until he caught the acting bug in 2007 after enrolling in an improvisational class, as means to overcome a fear of public speaking - which he faced due to a recent job promotion. Several staged productions followed including the 3rd Space Theatre production of Chicago Cab (1997) and joining the Atlanta improv comedy troupe "Whole World Theatre". In 2008, Tony Award winning director, Jerry Zaks, cast TJ in the biopic Who Do You Love (2008) as American blues musician, Lonnie Johnson, opposite Alessandro Nivola and Chi McBride. In 2009, TJ decided to leave Corporate America to peruse acting full-time. Shortly after, he landed a recurring role on the Lifetime original series Army Wives (2007) (TV Series) and several bit parts including Socorro, Ganhei a Lotaria! (2010) and Para Raparigas de Cor (2010).

    <hasBiography>   Born and raised in East London, Akshay's first exposure to the Arts came at 11 years old as a result of his mother's concerns over his 'painfully shy' nature, and so enrolled him in classes at a local stage school. Initially shunning acting, he found an unexpected love for dance - more specifically, hip-hop - and as a result turned his attention to pursuing a career as a dancer under the tutelage of the renowned hip-hop academy, TkSpin. By 16, however,Akshay found his way back to acting with the help of his high school drama teachers, who cast him as Don John in 'Much Ado About Nothing', as part of the annual Shakespeare Schools' Festival. Now assured that acting was the way forward, he went on to work with the National Youth Theatre, as well as beginning to build professional screen credits, with small roles in ITV's Lewis and BBC's Silent Witness. At 18, he successfully gained a place on the BA Acting course at The Drama Centre London. That same summer he landed the role of Aasef in the BBC 2 mini-series 'White Heat' (starring Sam Claflin, Claire Foy and Hugh Quarshie) and was approached by United Agents mid-production. Subsequently, he signed with United Agents the week prior to starting at The Drama Centre. Akshay's final year at the Drama Centre proved to be a busy one: securing his first lead role as the quiet, tech-savvy genius, Cam, in Unstoppable Entertainment's party film 'Legacy' (awaiting release). Shortly after, he played Nicki Veer to Ray Panthaki's Jay Veer in the romantic comedy 'One Crazy Thing' (directed by Amit Gupta, starring Ray Panthaki and Daisy Bevan), almost immediately followed by the role of Roshan Jabour, an Indian lascar, in ITV's 'The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher: Beyond the Pale' alongside Paddy Considine. A month before he was due to graduate, Akshay won the role of Rahim in the upcoming season of the multi-award winning show 'Homeland' (starring Claire Danes, Mandy Patinkin, Rupert Friend and Corey Stoll) premiering October 5th 2014.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Akshay Kumar   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Born in Melbourne Australia to Chinese immigrant parents, Fiona now resides in New York with her television-producer husband and their 2 sons. Fiona spent her youth performing in school/university musicals: roles included Nicky in Sweet Charity, Chiffon in Little Shop of Horrors, Eva Peron in Evita. She made her Australian television debut on the prime-time soap Neighbours, followed shortly by a guest starring role in the popular cop-drama Blue Heelers. After attaining a Bachelor of Commerce from Monash University (to please her parents), Fiona studied at the famed Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts. Upon graduating from WAAPA with a Bachelor of Performing Arts in Musical Theatre, Fiona moved to Sydney and was soon cast as a swing/understudy in the original Australian company of RENT, directed by Michael Greif. Over the course 15 months with RENT she had the opportunity to perform almost every female character in the show, including the charismatic lesbian performance artist Maureen. Somewhere along the way Fiona fell into freelance casting directing - most recent projects include the North American musical tour of Scooby-Doo Live! Musical Mysteries; promos for Big Lots, Jeep, Reckitt Benckiser and voice-over narrations for various AETN programs. Fiona has also been working with the theater company Core Ensemble for the last 10 years, first as an actress in The Silken Phoenix, and most recently as Resident casting and stage director.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Fiona Choi   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Rene Ifrah grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he was highly influenced by the multi-cultural surroundings of Sheepshead Bay/Gravesend/Brighton Beach's Italian/Jewish/Russian neighborhood.The majority of Rene's formal acting training began at the Laguardia High School for the Performing Arts in New York, and continued in Los Angeles under the guidance of William Alderson and Robert Carnegie.After being offered a role in a European television series during a two week vacation stint, Rene returned to Germany, the country of his birth, in 1999. The three weeks that he was supposed to be in the country have turned into six years and a promising TV and film career. Rene's first major challenge in Europe was relearning the German language. However, after struggling for only a few months, he was able to master the language without any trace of an accent.Rene began performing in the Berlin theater scene and was discovered by renowned casting agent Annette Borgmann while playing the lead character of Matthew in a production of 'Private Eyes' at the Friends of Italian Opera-The English Theater. This chance encounter led to Rene being cast in his first major role in the film "September", directed by the award-winning Max Faerberboeck. In this story, experiencing September 11th through German eyes, Rene played a Pakistani pizza store owner sympathetic to the terrorists on 9/11. The role was ideologically challenging, given Rene's own Jewish-American background. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival (2003), and consequently opened many new doors for him.His greatest success to date came as the lead in Miguel Alexandre's "With Love From Kashmir." In this film Rene played the role of a foreign architect, Sharif Mishra, living in Germany. Sharif is torn between his love for a German woman, and his sense of responsibility towards his family and his war-torn country of Kashmir. For this exceptional performance, Rene was honored with the prestigious Grimme Prize for Best Actor (2005).Action films have also proven to be well within Mr. Ifrah's range. In "Blood of the Templars", directed by the Oscar nominated Florian Baxmeyer, Rene played an assassin working for one of two rival Templar families. He underwent extensive physical training for the role, including martial arts and sword fighting techniques.Most recently Rene had the lead role in the comedy "Zorres" directed by Anja Jacobs. Going full circle Rene gets back to his roots, playing a German-Jewish character, Leo Rosen. Handsome, lovable, though a total mama's boy, Leo can't seem to get his life together. He works as a coach for a youth soccer team, consistently taking on too many responsibilities and consequently not being able to live up to them. The romantic comedy shows a very different side of Rene, and is a wonderful example of his diversity as a performer.With his roots firmly planted in New York's melting pot, René has been able to expand and broaden his technique from his many experiences in Europe. Whether playing a belligerent Pakastani immigrant, the conflicted partner in a multi-racial couple, or a goofy and charming Jewish soccer coach, Rene's talent continues to impress and entertain audiences.Considering the variety of strong roles behind him, we can certainly expect many more promising appearances from Rene Ifrah in the years to come.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Brian Bell   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Keith Flippen grew up in Lafayette, LA as an outcast "geek." In 1984, he and his family moved to VA where, to satisfy a school half-credit in the fine arts, Keith studied acting. In the theatre, he discovered a place of acceptance where his years of playing alone with his imagination would be of use. After graduating from Green Run High School, Keith attended VA Tech with the intention of becoming an Aerospace Engineer. Alas, based on his poor grades in Calculus, Keith decided that, if he were to ever design an aircraft, there would be a 40% chance of everyone aboard dying a terrifying and fiery death. He opted to pursue the thing for which he had a natural aptitude - acting.Upon graduation in 1990, Keith studied at the Eugene O'Neil Theatre Center and the Leningrad State Institute of Theatre, Music, and Film as part of a Soviet/American exchange program. There he met his dear friend and Russian "bother" Igor Kopilov. After a summer of in-depth study and performance, Keith returned to VA and began working in film, television, and theatre. He returned to Russia in 1992 as the US Administrator of the Russian American Theatre in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Minsk to oversee the creation, promotion, and performance of a bi-cultural Christmas program for every 6th grated in Byelorus - 40,000 children were brought to Minsk over 10 days to view the spectacle.Once back in the US, Keith performed with Young Audiences of VA bringing theatrical performances to children across the state. Soon, however, the demands of his film/TV work meant giving up his first love    the theatre. Keith continues to work as an actor and now owns The     Actors' Place, Inc. in Virginia Beach, VA where he teaches Meisner Technique and Camera Acting to students from across VA and NC.     - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Keith Flippen   </hasBiography>

That summer Jacob also had the privilege of working with one of his favorite actresses, Loretta Devine, in "Teachers" aka "Saving Westbrook High".Jacob's favorite school subjects are science, as well as, history, which made being cast as "Newt" in the new Revolutionary War series "Turn" an incredible experience.Jacob's favorite pastimes include drumming, cooking Italian food, and listening to Bach, Beethoven and the Beatles.Jacob was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Michael and Leigh Ann Leinbach.

    <hasBirthDate>30/07/1957</hasBirthDate>
    <hasBiography>   A staple of American stage, screen, and television for over 30 years, Victor Slezak hails from Youngstown, Ohio.Victor's earliest influences in entertainment came through the screen of Jack and Sam's Warner Brothers Theater, where his mother was a box office girl. So, too, was the black and white TV set in his parents' living room an early influence. He cites seeing Montgomery Clift in _Freud_, James Dean in Fúria de Viver (1955), and George C. Scott in the old East Side/West Side (1963) series as performances that piqued his earliest interest. The Franciscan nuns at Saint Stanislaus Grade School taught in the Jesuit mode, placing heavy weight on the correct use of language and oratory skill. Theatre was used as a teaching tool. At an early age, Victor's acting in, directing, and writing plays stemming from the Bible became a normal part of his daily routine and education. His talent and efforts gained recognition when he was asked to join a select handful of students in reading the Book of Genesis aloud to their church congregation. Toward the end of high school, after being selected and appearing in leads in the school plays, Victor's guidance counselor pulled him out of class to announce good news: he'd been awarded a scholarship to study acting at Ohio State. Victor turned it down. The summer before, Victor had spent 10 weeks as an apprentice at the Lakewood Musical Playhouse. There was another force and first love begging for his attention. From an early age he spent his free time making drawings in pencil and ink. He couldn't see himself pursuing acting as a career after seeing those amazing performers drawing their 75 dollar a week paycheck and no job after the ten weeks. So, at the ripe old age of 17, he moved to New York City to become a visual artist. He was on the fast track to become an advertising art director when a friend who worked as a scenic designer from that summer of stock called from out of the blue and asked Victor if he'd like to paint scenery for the venerable Chautauqua Opera Company in western New York state. Victor arranged for a brief leave of absence from the advertising firm. A life in the theatre had called to him by a most circuitous route. Victor never went back to the ad firm. When his work at Chautauqua ended, he landed a job stage managing variety acts - a country/western band, a juggler, and a magician - at the Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio. In an era before Amazon or Barnes and Noble existed, he began to hunt for books on acting. Victor's first introduction to Uta Hagen was in his Speech and Drama class where he heard a recording of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf".His first professional jobs came from regional theatre, roles like Rodolfo in A View from the Bridge at the Berkshire Theatre Festival and several stints at Hartford Stage, including Eben in Desire Under the Elms playing opposite Frances Fisher; Whit in Of Mice and Men with fellow Youngstowner Ed O'Neill, and Algernon in The Importance of Being Ernest with Mary Louise Parker. Exceptional material and the chance to work with great artists kept Victor in New York when so many of his peers moved west to pursue Los Angeles. Stage jobs in the city soon beckoned. Victor's performance as Lachlen in The Hasty Heart at Mirror Repertory off-Broadway led to his being cast opposite Geraldine Page at the same venue in a Ibsen's Ghosts, directed by Austin Pendleton. Television jobs followed including a recurring role on ABC's "Guiding Light". Broadway beckoned in 1993. Victor played John Cleary in Frank Gilroy's Any Given Day (the precursor to The Subject was Roses) alongside Sada Thompson at the Longacre Theatre, following that playing Dr. Sugar in Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer at Circle in the Square with Elizabeth Ashley, JFK in Jackie: An American Life with Margaret Colin at the Belasco, Mr. Robinson in The Graduate with Kathleen Turner at the Plymouth Theatre, and John the Baptist in Salome with Al Pacino at the Barrymore Theatre. Film roles began to pop up as well: Perigo Íntimo (1997) directed by Alan J. Pakula with Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt; As Pontes de Madison County (1995) with Meryl Streep, directed by Clint Eastwood. After Uta Hagen's death in 2004, Victor received phone calls from HB Studios asking him to consider teaching. Harkening to a need to give back to the school and the craft that had nurtured him, he eventually agreed to work a class into his schedule "I went to teach my first class and found that the Studio had put me in the same room where I'd first met Uta." Today, Victor serves on the Board of the HB Playwrights Foundation, a position he's held since 2009 and makes time each year to be a part of their CORE program. He is also a member of the Actor's Studio and The Ensemble Studio Theater. He is known throughout the industry for the research he brings to playing roles of particular power and complexity (Enrico Brulard, the totalitarian chef on HBO's _Treme_; the Deputy Director of CIA in John Singleton's feature Abduction; Jamie Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's Moon for the Misbegotten at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre; Mike Wallace in the Broadway-bound musical Superfly, directed by Bill T. Jones). Victor still approaches his roles with a painter's eye.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Damon DiMarco 2012   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Mandy Patinkin was born Mandel Bruce Patinkin in Chicago, Illinois, to Doris "Doralee" (Sinton), a homemaker and cookbook writer, and Lester Patinkin, who operated two scrap metal plants. He is of Russian Jewish and Latvian Jewish descent. Growing, up he began singing in synagogue choirs at the age of 13-14 and still continues to use his fantastic voice in musicals and in recordings. Attending Juilliard, he became good friends with actor Kelsey Grammer and upon hearing that Cheers, Aquele Bar (1982) was auditioning for the role of Dr. Frasier Crane he immediately put Grammer's name forward for the role. Rumours persist about Patinkin's sudden departure from Mentes Criminosas (2005). He simply failed to show up one day for a table read. He has contacted the entire cast to explain what is referred to as "personal reasons" for leaving. It seems that although Patinkin was prepared for the show to include violence the actual level of violence portrayed was unacceptable to the actor. He left to do more light hearted work. Patinkin supports many charities including: PAX, Doctors Without Borders, Americans for Peace Now, The September 11th Fund, Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America and Gilda's Club.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Dredzfall   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Born in Ft. Benning, Georgia, son to Henry Bazemore and Loretta Faye Bazemore, Henry Bazemore Jr.'s parents relocated to Flint, MI, taking advantage at that time of the growing automotive Industry. It was there that he grew up from humble beginnings. Remaining close to home, he attended the University of Michigan. A year before graduation Henry was coaxed into auditioning for an open casting call of the Tony Award winning play, The Grapes of Wrath. It was there, that he caught the acting bug.Henry received a B.A. in English with a specialization in writing, and a minor in theatre. Upon graduation, Henry was accepted to a number of Acting Graduate programs in the U.S. including, the prestigious Cal Arts, and DePaul University. Deciding to study at The University of Georgia on a full ride scholarship, he supplemented his education at the Actor's Studio in Atlanta and on the professional stage. Henry made his stage debut in Richard III at Richmond Shakes, playing a slew of characters including Sir James Tyrrell, Lord Grey, and Henry, the Earl of Richmond. Although graduating with honors, Henry felt he really didn't cut his teeth on acting until he worked in LORT and other Regional Theatres learning from other seasoned professional actors.This led to companies entrusting him with title roles such as Henry in Henry V, Cassius in Julius Caesar, Theseus and Oberon in a Midsummer Night's Dream, and supporting roles such as Le Bret in Cyrano de Bergerac, Lucentio in the Taming of the Shrew, and Carl in Bus Stop. Throwing his focus more towards film and television, Henry soon was cast in a comedic supporting role based on the book by G.K. Chesterton, entitled Man Alive. From there he appeared in a number of television shows such as Drop Dead Diva, Sleepy Hollow, and ShowTime's Homeland, while recurring in Army Wives, One Tree Hill and recently in Sundance's 2nd new original series, The Red Road.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Foster Blackman   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   After her debut film Mississipi Masala (1991) became an art house hit, Sarita Choudhury was determined not to "go Hollywood," focusing her acting energies on independent film instead.Raised in Jamaica, Mexico, and Italy, the half-Indian, half-English Choudhury studied economics at Queens University in Ontario before switching to acting. She casually auditioned for Mississipi Masala (1991) and wound up cast as the lead opposite Denzel Washington in the singular interracial romance between a Southern African American man and a transplanted Indian woman. Despite the film's surprise success, Choudhury stuck to her non-Hollywood roots, putting her exotic looks and talent to versatile use as a Pakistani country-western singer in Wild West (1992), a Chilean maid who is raped in Bille August's adaptation of A Casa dos Espíritos (1993), and a lesbian mother in Fresh Kill (1994).Choudhury worked with Mississipi Masala (1991) director Mira Nair again in A Família Perez (1995) and played the cuckolded queen Tara in Nair's frankly-sensual feminist parable Kama Sutra: Uma História de Amor (1996).By the late 1990s, Choudhury added a touch of Hollywood to her repertoire with supporting roles in the glossy Alfred Hitchcock remake, Um Homicídio Perfeito (1998) and the John Cassavetes retread Gloria (1999).   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Lucia Bozzola   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   On stage, television or the movie theatre screen Sebastian Koch is undeniably one of Germany s most multi-faceted and successful actors. Born in Karlsruhe, Germany, May 31, 1962, he spent his childhood and youth in Stuttgart, southwestern Germany. He planned to become a musician, but in the late seventies a Stuttgart theater production by director Claus Peymann, inspired him to change his professional direction and choose a career as an actor. He graduated in 1985 from the renowned Otto Falckenberg School of Acting in Munich. Initial career performances at Munich&amp;amp;acutes Theater der Jugend were followed by roles including Schiller s "Die Raeuber", Goethe s "Iphigenie", and "Dirty Dishes" from Nick Whitby in engagements at the Staedtischen Buehnen Ulm, the Staatstheater Darmstadt and the Staatlichen Buehnen Berlin. In 1986 he commenced his television career debuting on the side of Commissioner Helmut Fischer in the famous long-running German television Sunday night crime series "Tatort"-- "Die Macht des Schicksals." Innumerable crime stories and thrillers followed but it was in 1997 when director Heinrich Breloer cast Koch as Andreas Baader in the highly-acclaimed movie-of-the week two-parter "Todesspiel" which overnight changed his career. Five years later in 2002 Sebastian Koch achieved a feat not achieved in over 30 years of German television, he was awarded the coveted Grimme Prize for the leading roles in two television films, "Der Tanz mit dem Teufel - Die Entfuehrung des Richard Oetker", the story of the abduction of the heir to the Oetker fortune, as well as for his role in the three-part historical family drama "The Manns". The production "The Manns" was awarded Germany's esteemed honor as the "Television Event of the Year 2002". Koch received additional accolades for his role as Klaus Mann, including the Bavarian Television Prize. His international breakthrough came with the historical mini-series "Napoleon," alongside prominent colleagues including Gerard Depardieu, John Malkovich and Isabella Rossellini, and his role as Cathereine Deneuve's young lover, Rodolphe Loewenstein in "MARIE AND FREUD". Koch' s continued choice of roles in his career have provided an extremely intense examination of many personalities and themes pertaining to German history. Beginning theatrically in Constantin Costa-Gavras adaptation of Rolf Hochhuth's "AMEN" released in 2002, and then in successive German television events including the 2001 production of "The Tunnel", a two-part movie-of-the-week from Roland Suso Richter about the underground tunnel built from west to east Berlin which succeeded in enabling 100 people to flee the GDR; followed in 2003 with director Peter Keglevic's historical drama "Zwei Tage Hoffnung" about the infamous strike in the former GDR on June 17, 1953; and, the next year, in "Operation Valkryrie", the spectacular docu-drama from Jo Baier, awarded the German Television Prize, about the aristocratic soldier Clemens von Stauffenberg's perfect plot in 1944 to murder Hitler by smuggling a bomb into Hitler's bunker. In 2005 Koch collaborated for the third time with director Heinrich Breloer in "Speer and Hitler", the story of Hitler and his architect Albert Speer, garnering Koch both the German Television Prize and Bavarian Television Prize for Best Actor. Sebastian Koch was awarded the Bambi Award for Best Male German Actor 2006. Sebastian Koch is drawn to complex, flawed characters with rough edges. A particular loneliness and/or reclusiveness surrounds Koch's characters, even a certain sadness through which he finds the energy and tension for his roles. In 2006 his stunning performance as GDR dramatist/playwright Georg Dreymann in Florian Henkel von Donnermarck's Oscar-winning theatrical success, the Stasi-drama, "THE LIVES OF OTHERS" earned him the 2007 Italian Foreign Press Award, the Globo d'Oro for Best European Actor. In Paul Verhoeven s film "BLACK BOOK", which celebrated in 2006 premieres in Venice and Toronto and was nominated from the Netherlands for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Koch played the lead role as a Nazi officer in German-occupied Holland who falls in love with a Jewish Resistance Fighter (Carice van Houten). Under the direction of Hermine Huntgeburth ("The White Massai") alongside Julia Jentsch, Koch was most recently shooting EFFIE in the role of Geert von Instetten in the novel adaptation of "Effi Briest" by Theodor Fontane. Following the productions in Winter 2007/2008 of "Gegen den Strom" (Against the Current) and "The Interrogation of Harry Wind," Koch will travel to Canada for the lead role in the international coproduction of Jack London s classic "The Sea Wolf." The English language TV production, written by Nigel Williams ("Elizabeth I.") is being directed by Brit Mike Barker. Koch s German and international theatrical successes include the 2003 remake of Erich Kaestner s children s classic "DAS FLIEGENDE KLASSENZIMMER" from director Tomy Wiegand and "GLOOMY SUNDAY" from Rolf Schuebel (1999). In Spring 2007 Warner Brothers Germany released the family comedy sequel "RENNSCHWEIN RUDI RUESSEL 2" from Peter Timm. Sebastian Koch is alongside his theatrical and television activity a sought after reader for literary and musical audio books and the live performances of these productions. He returned to the theatre stage in 2006 after a long absence, performing the role of Lord Goring in Oscar Wildes "An Ideal Husband" under the direction of Armin Holz, a celebrated critical and audience success at the distinguished Schauspielhaus Bochum.Sebastian Koch makes his home in Berlin and has a daughter.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Anke Zindler, www.just-publicity.com   </hasBiography>

    <hasBiography>   Anthony Reynolds is an American film, television and theatre actor known for his work as a character actor playing authoritative roles as law enforcement officers, federal agents and military officials. Gravitating toward the character actors in the movies of his childhood, Anthony aspired to be a regular guy who plays to the leads in supporting roles. Upon completion of Cary High School in 1986, Anthony studied at North Carolina State University and East Carolina University and made almost annual trips to New York to visit the theatre and museums. His college years were interrupted by some harrowing twists and turns, but Anthony graduated from ECU in 1992 with a BFA in Communication Arts. In 1993, he drove with a friend to Los Angeles where he slept on the floor of his high school friend, Keith Coulouris' apartment in Studio City, CA. Keith was instrumental in Anthony getting a bit part in, Dead Man's Revenge (1994), a USA network movie of the week, starring Bruce Dern, Michael Ironside and Vondie Curtis-Hall. Upon realizing the high cost of living in LA, Anthony returned to the East Coast to study acting as he had no business on a film set without formal training. He spent just shy of two years in Atlanta, taking classes and auditioning, before his then agent, Ted Borden urged him to make the big move to Manhattan to study at The Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. In 1995, Anthony did just that. He lived in a NYU dorm with a student he met on his flight to New York after the living situation he had arranged prior to the move fell apart upon his arrival. The front door to the apartment that he was to be staying in had been kicked in and the tenants robbed the night before. He ended up bouncing between apartments on the Upper East and West Sides of the city. Concurrent to his studies at the LSTI, Anthony studied privately with acting coaches Michael Margotta and Geoffrey Horne. While performing off-off Broadway in numerous black box theaters, Anthony met Lamya Jezek. In 1999, upon her graduation from NYU's Tisch School for Acting, the newly engaged couple moved to Los Angeles as Lamya had secured representation. They were married July 14, 2001, in North Carolina. In LA, Anthony studied with Milton Katselas at The Beverly Hills Playhouse and with Lesly Kahn in the Hollywood Hills. Anthony found that the best training of all, was working on sets with other actors. He had the privilege of working with Academy Award Nominated actor, Edward Norton for nine years on several films as well as Academy Award and Golden Globe Winner, Billy Bob Thornton on four films. Anthony maintains a number of relationships in NY and LA, but chose to return to his Southern roots to raise his family. Anthony and his family have resided on the East Coast since 2008, where he continues to work regularly in film and television.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Vernell Ledbetter   </hasBiography>

    <hasSeriesAppearance rdf:resource="http://www.semanticweb.org/tv/series/ontologies/Tv-Series-Ontology#segurança_nacional_"/>
    <hasBiography>   In a career spanning four decades, actor Bob Elkins has played a range of diverse characters too numerous to remember, but too compelling to forget. Despite impossible deadlines, sleep-depriving rehearsal schedules and grueling projects that required him to endure hours in rain, snow and scorching heat, his toughest role may have been the one into which he was born and from which he eventually fled, hiding in the spotlight, seeking the approval of strangers.Bob Elkins spent his first five years of life in the tiny mountain town of Mt. Hope, West Virginia, the son of a struggling coal miner, and the only brother of two sisters. One of his earliest memories is that of a real-life drama: a nearby creek overflowing its banks, muddy floodwaters inundating the first floor of his two-story house. Oblivious to the danger at hand, young Bob rode his tricycle through the rapidly rising water in the downstairs hallway, his mother desperately yelling for him to come upstairs. He made it just in time, sadly watching the tricycle, his prized possession, get swept away.In search of better job opportunities and more stable living conditions, Bob's family moved from West Virginia to Muncie, Indiana, where his father went to work for a lawnmower company. The family's economic situation improved slightly, but emotionally, things deteriorated as a result of an invisible wall that his father was slowly and steadily beginning to build around himself.School was a constant struggle, as Bob had difficulty comprehending textbooks and what teachers were writing on the chalkboard. Little did he or anyone else realize it at the time, but he suffered from dyslexia, a learning disability that would not be identified until much later.When Bob was 12, his family moved to Covington, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. It was in that year that a pivotal and tragic event occurred that haunts Bob even now. One day, without warning or explanation, his father simply walked away from home, never to be seen or heard from again. Understandably, Bob was devastated.Bob fell in love with films because they were an escape. He could escape the fact that his father was gone. He went to movie after movie after movie. He didn't realize it at the time, but he thinks those movies planted the first seed of his interest in acting.To support her fractured family, Bob's mother took a job as a maid, and his sisters went to work part-time. With grades suffering and, for all practical purposes, no parental supervision, Bob became friends with other teenagers who introduced him to crime.He got involved with a kid at school who was a bookie. He was a real genius at math. He figured out the odds. Bob was the front guy. He collected all the bets and paid the winners. He also took care of any disagreements. Non-violently, of course.Bob's career in illegal gambling came to an end when one of his sisters discovered the books he kept, and convinced him that what he was doing was wrong. Bob quit working for his bookie friend, but continued down an equally dangerous path, hanging out with a rough crowd, staying out late at night and stealing things, like boxes of cigarettes. On one occasion, the group stole a car and took it for a joyride. Bob's life of youthful crime came to an abrupt halt when one night, he and his buddies got caught breaking into a coal company office.A police officer arrested them and took them to the police station. He told them what would happen if they was sent to reform school. And that stopped his life of crime.Because of failing grades, Bob attended summer school for five years. He also worked odd jobs, and became involved in sports. At the age of 18, like many young men his age, he joined the U.S. Navy. It was a turning point in Bob's life, as the Navy gave 600 recruits an aptitude test, the top 5% of whom were selected to go to college at the government's expense. Bob was among the top 5%.Although he refused the Navy's offer of free college tuition, Bob accepted an alternate offer to attend military school. Quickly promoting him to the rank of Petty Officer, the Navy put Bob in charge of a division on a ship, a job that gave him a much-needed boost of self-confidence.The Navy taught him that he wasn't just some stupid kid. he spent four years with Uncle Sam. It was an experience that really turned his life around.While in the Navy, Bob learned that his earlier academic difficulties were the result of dyslexia. One of Bob's best friends in the Navy, gunnery officer Lt. Jack Russell, taught Bob to read more efficiently. It was another turning point in Bob's life, as he began reading more, and higher-quality books.After Bob was discharged from the Navy, a friend talked him into attending night school, which the government paid for. Bob studied liberal arts for a year-and-a-half before his life took yet another turn, when he noticed a newspaper ad for an acting school in Cincinnati.Bob was able to draw from his experience in the Navy for his first professional acting job, a small part as a shore patrol officer in a stage production of the comedy Mister Roberts. A year later, he found himself playing the lead role in that same play.From the beginning, Bob enjoyed glowing reviews, and earned praise from fellow actors and directors. One director encouraged him to move to New York or Hollywood, to pursue work on Broadway, or in movies. However, romance intervened, and at age 25 Bob got married, and chose to stay in the Cincinnati area. During the next few years, he and his wife had four children.Bob continued acting, appearing in dozens of plays and TV commercials. Like most professional actors, though, he was not able to earn a living doing what he most enjoyed, so he supported his family by working a series of day jobs. One of his jobs was that of a salesman for a Fortune 500 chemical company. Despite having failed chemistry in high school, Bob worked his way up to the position of assistant vice president of the company's industrial division.Bob's acting career received a sudden boost in 1980, when he auditioned for and won a part in the motion picture A Filha do Mineiro (1980), starring _Sissy Spacek_ and _Tommy Lee Jones_.Bob as Bobby Day the DJ in Coal Miner's DaughterBob's experience working on Coal Miner's Daughter taught him a lot about acting for motion pictures.Unfortunately, Bob's personal life was not going nearly as well as his professional life seemed to be. Shortly after filming Coal Miner's Daughter, his marriage ended in divorce. It was the second major traumatic event of his life, leaving him in a deep state of depression.Unable to get motivated, Bob passed up several professional opportunities during this period. Finally, facing a mid-life crisis, he gave up the more stable corporate life to pursue acting full time, moving with a friend to Orlando, Florida.Disappointed with the acting opportunities in Orlando, Bob returned to Cincinnati, where he remained for several years, working in theater and getting occasional movie and television roles, including one in which he co-starred with Sandy Dennis in Trouble With Mother.After Bob's children were grown, he decided to take another stab at Hollywood, this time hitting the road for Los Angeles. In L.A., Bob studied acting under such professionals as Dee Marcus and Jason Alexander (George on Seinfeld). He also did several plays, including Passion Fruit, and movies that included The Big Day, with Saundra Seacat. However, good acting jobs were few and far between, and like many actors in Hollywood, Bob ran out of money and decided to return home. It might have been the best decision he ever made.Back in Cincinnati, Bob immediately began getting work in a variety of motion pictures and television shows, including This Train with Soupy Sales, and Tattered Angel with Lynda Carter. More recently, he had a supporting role in the ABC television movie The Pennsylvania Miners' Story, in which he played the father of a trapped miner, and the acclaimed docu-drama James Cameron's Expedition: Bismarck on the Discovery Channel, in which he portrayed German Admiral Gunther Lutgens.In February of 2003, Bob was honored to win the Best Actor Award in the Dublin Film and Music Festival in Ireland, for his portrayal of a homeless man in the independent film Homefree, written and directed by Greg Newberry.Bob as a homeless man in _Homefree(2002)_ by Greg Newberry. He is starring in several feature films including Act of Contrition (2015)coming out in 2015. He is working on several projects with _Carrie-Ellen Zappa_ including teaching acting for Zappa Studios.   - IMDb Mini Biography By:  Carrie-Ellen Zappa   </hasBiography>
